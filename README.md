MySQL to PostgreSQL Converter
=============================

Based Lanyrd's MySQL to PostgreSQL conversion script. Use with care.

This script was designed for our specific database and column requirements - notably, it doubles the lengths of VARCHARs due to a unicode size problem we had, places indexes on all foreign keys, and presumes you're using Django for column typing purposes.

The script upgraded for compatibility with latest Python / MariaDB / MySQL / PostgreSQL versions. My aim is successfully to migrate and transfer a few gigs of MariaDB WordPress db to PostgreSQL.

How to use
----------

First, dump your MySQL database in PostgreSQL-compatible format

```
mysqldump --compatible=postgresql --default-character-set=utf8 -r databasename.mysql -u root databasename
```

Then, convert it using the dbconverter.py script

`python db_converter.py databasename.mysql databasename.psql`

It'll print progress to the terminal.

Finally, load your new dump into a fresh PostgreSQL database using: 

`psql -f databasename.psql`
